Excel-Table version 1.011
=========================

Many spreadsheets are used to store semi-structured lists, such as
catalogues, manifests, etc. in a table-like structure. These files
typically evolve over time, and come to resemble databases,
particularly in the case of Excel workbooks, where multiple
worksheets are used in unison.

Whilst DBD::Excel can be used to provide an SQL-like interface to
such sheets, it may not be practical to do so, and certainly for
programmers not familiar or comfortable with SQL. This is
particularly true for spreadsheets which have evolved over time and
may not exhibit good database design, such as normalisation or
consistent "column" naming.

This module allows sheet data (assumed to be similarly structured
to tables) to be processed as arrays (or hashes if desired) of rows
with the ability to retrieve meta-data such as maximum value length,
titles, etc. It also allows for duplicate column naming which often
occur in such sheets which don't lend themselves well to handling
via DBD.

It leverages existing Excel parsing modules and as such caters to
older and newer Excel formats.
